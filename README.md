## About

***

[Wescout](https://github.com/JackDilger/wescout-milestone-3)  is player management database built for professionals working in the Football industry. Users of the site can discover new talent by browsing and searching for existing players and learn key information, such as market value or read more in-depth player analysis from other users. This app has a clean and intuitive interface which allows users to easily maintain player information, users can securely add, edit, and delete player data once they register for an account. 


## Strategy and planning

***

Why football?

Football is the most popular sport in the world, with an estimated following of 4 billion fans. It is a global sport played by hundreds of millions of people around the world. It's a game that breaks down social boundaries like no other sport and is inclusive
to everyone, connecting people of opposite cultures. The UK Sports Industry alone is worth Â£23.8 billion and holds nearly 1 million jobs, none more important than scouts. The biggest clubs have worldwide scouting networks and some full-time scouts can work up to 80 hours a week, watching many games in many different countries. With such a vast amount of data, it is crucial that you have somewhere to securely maintain information on your players.


The Wescout app aims to be a hub for football scouts and professionals working in the industry, whereby they can safely store player information and capture key data about them all in one place. Player information is always changing, whether they are moving clubs or their market value is fluctuating due to performance. This is why it is important you can update this information easily or delete records of players you are no longer monitoring. The Wesout app allows users to seamlessly manage all player data in this way with the ability to add, edit and delete player information on the go at any time on any device. 

It's normal to be maintaining information on hundreds of players at a time as a football scout, therefore it is vital to be able to quickly locate player information without spending hours scrawling through lists of information. The Wescout app has an intuitively designed search index, you can find an individual player instantly by searching their name or filter the database to only display your own added players. 

We want to build a community of people in the football industry and develop the site in this direction of a collaborative approach towards scouting. Discovering fresh talent can be challenging and costly and we wanted to offer a solution to this. That is why we wanted users to be able to collaborate by sharing player data. As well being able to maintain your own information you can browse the full list of players added by other Wescout professionals. 

One of our main aims with doing this, was to ensure though that your own information was kept secure. We understand the important of safely managing data online, which is why we used a multitude of defensive programming features in the app to ensure your information is safe.

## Existing Features and how they align to user stories

***

- __Logo-Links to user story 1 & 2__

  - The head of the page contains the 'Wescout' logo. The logo was designed to represent the websites target audience and purpose.
  - The text content of the logo 'Wescout', offers an indication to the user what the site offers and who it is built for. The player ID icon also lends to this by showing it is a place for player information.
  - The logo also serves as a clickable link, allowing users a straightforward way to navigate back to the home page at any time. The logo is consistently situated on each page of the website because of this.

## Data Schema

***

![Schema](wescout/static/images/readme/schema.JPG)

The above image shows the information being stored across the 2 databases and the links between the 2. I chose to use both a relational and non-relational database in the Wescout app, with both linking together where appropriate. Each database stores the information that is relevant to its strengths.

I used relational database with POSTGRESQL and SQLALCHEMY for user authentication data and my list of scouting regions. The reason being that this is structured information that is unlikely to change, which lends itself to the strengths of this type of database. The user and region data is stored in rows and columns in a structured manner and data that can be changed is stored only on one location. 

I used a non-relational database with MONGODB for the player information. The reason being that all player details are vastly different which lends itself perfectly to this type of database; with its main strength of storing unstructured document-based information.

The unique region ID is inputted into each player document linking the 2 databases together. This ensures if a region is to be deleted, all players from that region would be removed from the database as well. This helps to ensure there is no redundant information being stored in MONGODB. This cascade delete function is a powerful feature so it is restricted so that only the website admin can have control over it.

The username for each registered user is store into each player document. This is super important, as this allows the app to know who each player was 'created by' and use defensive programming to ensure only a user themselves can edit/delete their saved player data.


## Defensive programming features

***

Security was focused on throughout the app to ensure player data was handled in a safe manor, a number of defensive features were
built into the design:

- The 'Add Player' button on the main home page will run a check to see a user is in session and redirect them to register/login if not. It's important players are logged in to their user profiles before being able to add players so we know who players were 'created by'. 
- The edit and delete buttons both run checks to see who the listed players were 'created by', this ensures that any user in session will only be permitted to edit or delete players they have added to the database. They cannot edit or delete players added by other users. 
- If a delete button is clicked, instead of deleting the chosen information instantly a modal is launched which offers the user the choice to either proceed or cancel the request. 
- Weâve used Werkzeug to hash passwords for each user when registering to site. This adds an additional layer of security by allowing the data to be stored in a format that can't be reversed at any reasonable amount of time or cost for a hacker.
- Only once a user registers to the site will they be given access to the add player and profile pages. These nav bar links are
hidden until a user is in session. 
- The scouting regions page is only visible to the website admin when logged. This nav bar link his hidden to all other users. The functions for adding/deleting/editing regions all run checks to ensure only the admin user can carry out these actions.

### Future development

***

This is very much version one of the website and there are many features I would like to develop and apply in future to help further improve it:

- I will be adding a 'My Watchlist' Feature to the user profile page. These will allow users to manage their favourite players on configurable lists and keep them organised to make player analysis easier. This will involve adding a like button next to the edit and delete button on the player collapsible. Only users logged in and registered to their account will be able to make use of this feature. The function behind this will render a list of the users liked players in their 'Watchlist' on the profile page. This would mean remodelling my data schema so the database can keep track of users liked players. I think this will be a great feature for our target audience, it will allow them to quickly find a full list of their favourite players making it easier to keep track of players of interest. 
- I would really like to implement a direct chat feature on the website, this would really benefit our users by allowing them to create contacts with likeminded professionals in the industry. This would help build the Wescout community and push towards a collaborative approach towards scouting as intended in our initial planning stage. This feature would take longer to implement as it would mean using technologies I am not yet familiar with. After some research I think the best way of doing this would be to implement a already built chat API like this one found on [getstream.io](https://getstream.io/chat/?utm_source={google}&utm_medium={cpc}&utm_campaign=GOO|S|NB|ROW|ALL-EN|Core%26utm_adgroup=Chat%26utm_custom%3D15846636712%26utm_content%3D574272573811%26utm_term%3Dchat%20service%20for%20website%26matchtype=p%26device=c%26location=1006912&_bt=574272573811&_bk=chat%20service%20for%20website&_bm=p&_bn=g&gclid=CjwKCAjwwdWVBhA4EiwAjcYJEOvwfDTFmJDPf7ozzz5N-w0hQGt3_YgY8GVSEiLWaT0_pG8K3H6e1xoCWFMQAvD_BwE). 
- I would also like users to have the ability to document match reports on players saved to their watchlist. This would really take the player analysis to the next level and would be a key feature in growing the user base. Player performance in game is what matters the most when scouting players, and it would be an essential feature to be able to keep track of players performance. This would really help in meeting our target audiences need for this. I would use a form input which would allow a select field with a list of your watch listed players and allow free form text input to keep track match statistics. These types of reports would be unstructured data that could easily be stored in my non-relational database in MONGODB. 


### Known bugs and Fixed bugs during development


- The site has been fully tested and there are no known bugs.

Here is a list of notable bugs during development: 
    
- The select dropdown field for regions on the add player form was not working- After looking through the code I found that I had not initialized the component with necessary JavaScript. Once this was added this bug was fixed. 
- When adding a new player using the add player form, the player information was not being posted to my 'Players' collection which I had already created. Instead, the document was being inserted into a new collection that was automatically created called 'Player'. The fault found here was a simple spelling mistake in the add player function which was fixed by adding the plural players not player to the insert document line. 
- When testing the site to ensure user feedback was showing for each action, I could see no feedback was showing for any action taken in the regions page by the admin user. The flash message was set up in the function, but I was not returning the correct template where the flash message was being displayed. Changing this was simple by updating the URL for link to display the correct page where the flash message was shown. 


## Deployment

This app was deployed very early on during development to Heroku and linked to GitHub so that changes made to the development environment would update on the live site as soon as they were pushed from Gitpod.

Deployment was carried out as follows:

1. Open project in Gitpod and run the command *pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt* - this creates a txt file that Heroku reads to check which dependencies are in use on the site.
2. Create a Procfile manually or by running the command *echo web: python run.py > Procfile* ('run.py' should be whatever the main python file is called). **Remove any blank line from the bottom of the new Procfile and ensure these changes are pushed to Github before proceeding.**
3. Log in (or create an account) on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), select 'Create new app', fill out the name (dashes instead of spaces) of your app, your closest region, and finally click 'Create app'.
4. Navigate to the 'Deploy' tab on the dashboard and select Github, then search for your repository and click 'connect'.
5. Navigate to the 'Settings' tab, click 'Reveal Config Vars', and fill them out as follows:

| Key         | Value
| -----------  | ---------- 
| IP           | 0.0.0.0
| MONGO_DBNAME | *my_mongodb_name*
| MONGO_URI	   | mongodb+srv://root:<*password*>@cluster0.sgi7e.mongodb.net/<*database_name*>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
| PORT         | 5000
| SECRET_KEY   | *my_secret_key*
| DATABASE_URL | *postgresql URL*


6. Return to the 'Deploy' tab and select 'Enable Automatic Deploys', ensuring that the master branch is selected.
7. Click 'Deploy Branch' and wait for Heroku to build the app. You can monitor the progress in the 'Latest Activity' of the overview.
8. Once the build has been completed, click 'Open app' to check that the live site is working.

## Cloning

To clone this project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Click on the 'Code' dropdown and copy the command present on 'GitHub CLI'.
3. Paste the command into the terminal on your IDE.
4. Install the dependencies present in *requirements.txt* by running *pip3 install -r requirements.txt* in the terminal.
5. Create a MongoDB database that includes the collections displayed in the above schema (or whatever specification you require for this clone).
6. Create an environment python file and include the following:
   * os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
   * os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
   * os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "[SECRET KEY]")
   * os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "[MONGO URI"])
   * os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "[YOUR DB NAME]")
   * os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "postgresURL")

*You will need to create your own secret key and get the uri and URL code from MongoDb* 

7. At this stage you should be able to launch the preview by running 'python3 app.py' in the terminal.

*Note - make sure to include your env.py file in the .gitignore file so that no sensitive information is pushed to GitHub.
