The biggest clubs have worldwide scouting networks, some full-time scouts can work up to 80 hours a week, watching many games in many different countries. With such a vast amount of data, its crucial that you have somewhere to securely maintain information on your players.


The Wescout app aims to be a hub for football scouts and professionals working in the industry, where by they can safely store player information and capture key data about them all in one place.
