## Strategy and planning

Why football?

Football is the most popular sport in the world, with an estimated following of 4 billion fans. It is a global sport played by hundreds of millions people around the world. It's a game that breaks down social boundaries like no other sport and is inclusive
to everyone, connecting people of opposite cultures. The UK Sports Industry alone is worth Â£23.8 billion and holds nearly 1 million jobs, none more important than scouts. The biggest clubs have worldwide scouting networks, some full-time scouts can work up to 80 hours a week, watching many games in many different countries. With such a vast amount of data, its crucial that you have somewhere to securely maintain information on your players.


The Wescout app aims to be a hub for football scouts and professionals working in the industry, where by they can safely store player information and capture key data about them all in one place. Players information is always changing, whether they are moving clubs or their market value is fluctuating due to performance. This is why it is important you can update this information easily, or delete records of players you are no longer monitoring. The Wesout app allows users to seamlessly  manage all player data in this way with the ability to add, edit and delete player information on the go at any time on any device. 

It's normal to be maintaining information on hundreds of players at a time as a football scout, that is why it is important to be able to quickly locate player information without spending hours scrawling through lists of information. The Wescout app has an intuitively designed search index, you can find an individual player instantly by searching their name or filter the database to only display your own added players. 

We want to build a community of people in the football industry and develop the site in this direction of a collaborative approach towards scouting. Discovering new players can be challenging and costly and we wanted to offer a solution to this. That is why we wanted users to be able to collaborate by sharing player data. As well being able to maintain your own information you can browse the full list of players added by other Wescout professionals. 

One of our main aims with doing this, was to ensure though that your own information was kept secure. We understand the important of safely managing data online, which is why we used a multitude of defensive programming features in the app to ensure your information is safe.
