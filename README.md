## Strategy and planning

***

In the planning stage of this website once I knew a quiz format was going to be the main design, I wanted to choose an area I was personally enthusiastic about as well as something with a wider popularity and target audience so I could gather as many potential users as possible. 

The rationale behind the Pokémon theme itself aligns perfectly with the overall goal of garnering as many site users as possible. The entire Pokémon media franchise is the highest-grossing entertainment media franchise of all time, having grossed an estimated $90 billion in lifetime revenue. Pokémon Go is the most-downloaded mobile game, with over 1 billion downloads. In addition, the Pokémon video game series has sold a total of over 1.3 billion units in retail sales and official downloads.

The popularity in numbers alone, would help massively in targeting as many people as possible to play our online quiz. I wanted  a theme that would be appealing to a wider range of people and again Pokémon fits this perfectly. The first video game was released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy and you may be forgiven for thinking its main demographic is 'just for kids', but this is not the case. A 2020 study published in the journal Heliyon pegged the average age of Pokémon Go players at 25. Following the release of Pokémon Sun and Moon in 2016, Nintendo revealed that the duo of 3DS games attracted more players in their 20s and 30s than any entry had previously. The trend cleary shows Pokémon players are growing up with these games, exactly as I have done in my own experience. 


After researching the most popular online Pokémon quiz's it was clear the multiple choice quiz format was the most widley used which is the reason this format was used, I did add some further features to the quiz though as I wanted to include more of a competitive edge to the quiz which is explained further in the features section below. I purposely made the quiz quite difficult as I did not want people to complete it first time around so they would have incentive to play again. When testing the site, I got multiple people with varied Pokémon knowledge to test the quiz to ensure there was a good balance for all player types.
At the time of planning Pokémon Legends: Arceus was the most recent release from the franchise, I wanted to implement a giveaway as a way to reward players who complete the quiz. The answer required for the giveaway will be available only once a user finished the quiz, this is done purposefully to ensure we are getting as many completions as possible to maximise site traffic.
